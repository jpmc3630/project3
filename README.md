Check it out live: <https://synths.herokuapp.com>
(sadly I'm not hosting any synths lateley, so unless you are planning on hosting one, you might just have to check out the screenshot below!)

## About
A web app that interfaces with physical hardware. Primarily designed to allow users to host hardware audio synthesisers online, and allow other users to remotely connect and use the hardware synths to design sounds in real time. Users can save sound design ‘patches’ to their accounts. Built in React and served with Node/Express. Audio and video streams use WebRTC, synth control data uses SocketIO & WebMidi API.
